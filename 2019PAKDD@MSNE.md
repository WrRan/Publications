**Title**: MSNE: A Novel Markov Chain Sampling Strategy for Network Embedding

**Abstract**:
> Network embedding methods have obtained great progresses on many tasks, such as
> node classification and link prediction. Sampling strategy is very important in
> network embedding. It is still a challenge for sampling in a network with 
> complicated topology structure. In this paper, we propose a high-order **M**arkov
> chain **S**ampling strategy for **N**etwork **E**mbedding (MSNE). MSNE selects
> the next sampled node based on a distance metric between nodes. Due to high-order
> sampling, it can exploit the whole sampled path to capture network properties and
> generate expressive node sequences which are beneficial for downstream tasks. We
> conduct the experiments on several benchmark datasets. The results show that our
> model can achieve substantial improvements in two tasks of node classification and
> link prediction.
