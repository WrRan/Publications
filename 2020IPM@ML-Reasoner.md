**Title**: A Novel Reasoning Mechanism for Multi-Label Text Classification

**Abstract**:
> The aim in multi-label text classification is to assign a set of labels to a given document.
> Previous classifier-chain and sequence-to-sequence models have been shown
> to have a powerful ability to capture label correlations. However, they rely heavily
> on the label order, while labels in multi-label data are essentially an unordered set.
> The performance of these approaches is therefore highly variable depending on the
> order in which the labels are arranged. To avoid being dependent on label order, we
> design a reasoning-based algorithm named Multi-Label Reasoner (ML-Reasoner) for
> multi-label classification. ML-Reasoner employs a binary classifier to predict all labels
> simultaneously and applies a novel iterative reasoning mechanism to effectively utilize
> the inter-label information, where each instance of reasoning takes the previously predicted likelihoods
> for all labels as additional input. This approach is able to utilize information between labels,
> while avoiding the issue of label-order sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
> outperforms state-of-the art approaches on the challenging AAPD dataset. We also apply our
> reasoning module to a variety of strong neural-based base models and show that it is able
> to boost performance significantly in each case
