Title: Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Mechanism for Multi-Label Text Classification

Abstract:

> Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) is a fundamental and challenging task in natural
> language processing. Previous studies mainly focus on learning text representation and
> modeling label correlation. However, they neglect the rich knowledge from the existing
> similar instances when predicting labels of a specific text. To address this oversight,
> we propose a k nearest neighbor (kNN) mechanism which retrieves several neighbor
> instances and interpolates the model output with their labels. Moreover, we design a
> multi-label contrastive learning objective that makes the model aware of the kNN 
> classification process and improves the quality of the retrieved neighbors during inference.
> Extensive experiments show that our method can bring consistent and considerable performance
> improvement to multiple MLTC models including the state-of-the-art pretrained and 
> non-pretrained ones.
